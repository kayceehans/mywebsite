                        Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world of stock management, enabling businesses to optimize their inventory control and make data-driven decisions. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning algorithms have empowered AI systems to analyze vast amounts of data, identify complex patterns, and predict demand with unprecedented accuracy. For instance, AI-powered demand forecasting tools can process historical sales data, market trends, and external factors like weather and social sentiment to anticipate future demand. This allows retailers to adjust their inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and minimize waste. Companies like Walmart are already leveraging AI-based shelf monitoring systems to automatically detect low-stock situations and trigger restocking alerts, ensuring that shelves remain stocked and customer demand is met.
